risk within reasonable bounds by sticking with issues rated at least A by Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s rating services. Also consider so-called AMT bonds. These bonds are subject to the alternative minimum (income) tax and, therefore, are not attractive to individuals who have sheltered a significant part of their income from tax. But if you are not subject to the alternative minimum tax, you can get some extra yield from holding AMT bonds. There is one nasty “heads I win, tails you lose” feature of bonds. If interest rates go up, the price of your bonds will go down. But if interest rates go down, the issuer can often “call” the bonds away from you (repay the debt early) and then issue new bonds at lower rates.

Effectively expressing your emotional needs is even better than the other person magical y reading your mind. It means that you’re an active agent who can be heard, and it opens the door for a much richer emotional dialogue. Even if Tom stil chose not to join Rebecca, if he understood how she felt, he could find another way to reassure her: “If you real y want me to go, I wil . But I also want to relax. How about we go out tonight—just the two of us? Would that make you feel better? You don’t real y want me at your sister’s anyway, do you? I wil get in the way of the two of you catching up.” Preventing Conflict—Attachment Biology 101 When it comes to conflict, it’s not always about who did what to whom, or how to compromise, or even how to express yourself more effectively. Sometimes, understanding the basic biology of attachment helps you prevent conflict before it even happens. Oxytocin, a hormone and neuropeptide that has gotten a lot of press coverage in recent years, plays a major role in attachment processes and serves several purposes: It causes women to go into labor, strengthens attachment, and serves as a social cohesion hormone by increasing trust and cooperation. We get a boost of oxytocin in our brain during orgasm and even when we cuddle—which is why it’s been tagged the “cuddle hormone.” How is oxytocin related to conflict reduction? Sometimes we spend less quality time with our partner—especial y when other demands on us are pressing. However, neuroscience findings suggest that we should change our priorities. By forgoing closeness with our partners, we are also missing our oxytocin boost—making us less agreeable to the world around us and more vulnerable to conflict. The next time you decide to skip the Sunday morning cuddle in bed for a chance to catch up on your work—think again. This smal act might be enough to immunize your relationship against conflict for the next few days. WHY INSECURE PEOPLE DON’T APPROACH CONFLICT HEAD-ON Several aspects of the anxious and avoidant mind-sets make it difficult for them to adopt secure conflict resolution principles. For the anxious, conflict can trigger very basic concerns about their partner’s responsiveness to their needs and about rejection or abandonment. When a dispute arises, they experience many negative thoughts and react by using protest behavior, aimed at getting their partner’s attention. They may make strong accusations, cry, or give their partner the silent treatment. Fearful

Choices are a problem, because choices force you to decide what you want to do. What happens when you turn “I want to” into “I have to”? You make it to work on time. Punctuality is nonnegotiable. Getting to work on time is not a goal; it’s a task. So is making dinner; you have no choice. So is taking care of your kids; it’s nonnegotiable. Going to the gym, on the other hand, is a goal. We may want to work out . . . but we don’t have to work out. You don’t make it to the gym because you can negotiate, if only with yourself, and make other choices. That’s why the power of routine, something we’ll look at in detail later, is so important. When you create a routine, embrace that routine, and see the results of that routine, you stop negotiating with yourself. You see your routine as a task, in the best possible way: Your routine isn’t something you choose to do; it’s just what you do.

If you play sport, you probably decided long ago which position on the pitch best suits your talents. Your experiences have made you much more set in your ways than you once were.

A beginner will start with whichever part of somebody’s portrait tickles their fancy. And a beginner is happy to start off playing anywhere on the field, even if they might make a fool of themselves. They’re more willing to make mistakes, and these mistakes are precisely what’s needed to learn.
