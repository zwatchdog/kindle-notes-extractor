"Effectively expressing your emotional needs is even better than the other person magical y reading your mind.

How about we go out tonight—just the two of us? Would that make you feel better? You don’t real y want me at your sister’s anyway, do you? I wil get in the way of the two of you catching up.” Preventing Conflict—Attachment Biology 101 When it comes to conflict, it’s not always about who did what to whom, or how to compromise, or even how to express yourself more effectively. Sometimes, understanding the basic biology of attachment helps you prevent conflict before it even happens. Oxytocin, a hormone and neuropeptide that has gotten a lot of press coverage in recent years, plays a major role in attachment processes and serves several purposes: It causes women to go into labor, strengthens attachment, and serves as a social cohesion hormone by increasing trust and cooperation. We get a boost of oxytocin in our brain during orgasm and even when we cuddle—which is why it’s been tagged the “cuddle hormone.” How is oxytocin related to conflict reduction? Sometimes we spend less quality time with our partner—especial y when other demands on us are pressing. However, neuroscience findings suggest that we should change our priorities. By forgoing closeness with our partners, we are also missing our oxytocin boost—making us less agreeable to the world around us and more vulnerable to conflict. The next time you decide to skip the Sunday morning cuddle in bed for a chance to catch up on your work—think again. This smal act might be enough to immunize your relationship against conflict for the next few days. WHY INSECURE PEOPLE DON’T APPROACH CONFLICT HEAD-ON Several aspects of the anxious and avoidant mind-sets make it difficult for them to adopt secure conflict resolution principles. For the anxious, conflict can trigger very basic concerns about their partner’s responsiveness to their needs and about rejection or abandonment. When a dispute arises, they experience many negative thoughts and react by using protest behavior, aimed at getting their partner’s attention. They may make strong accusations, cry, or give their partner the silent treatment. Fearful",Attached: The New Science of Adult Attachment and How It Can Help You Find and Keep Love .epub,Amir Levine
